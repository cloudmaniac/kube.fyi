# ETCD

In the context of Kubernetes, etcd is a distributed key-value store that is used to store the cluster's data and configuration. etcd is a critical component of the Kubernetes system, as it provides the "source of truth" for the cluster's current state. It is used by the various components of Kubernetes to store and retrieve data about the state of the cluster, such as the current status of the nodes, the applications running on the cluster, and the desired state of the applications. etcd is highly available and provides strong consistency guarantees, ensuring that all components of the cluster have a consistent view of the data. This is important for ensuring the correct operation of the cluster and the applications running on it.
