# Introduction

## Ferre hinnitibus erat accipitrem dixi Troiae tollens

Kubernetes is a popular open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

It provides a platform for creating and managing clusters of containerized applications, allowing developers to focus on building their applications rather than the underlying infrastructure.

Kubernetes uses a declarative approach to cluster management, allowing users to specify the desired state of their applications and the system takes care of ensuring that the actual state matches the desired state. This makes it easier to deploy and manage complex applications at scale.
